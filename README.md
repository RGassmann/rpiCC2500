rpiCC2500: An implementation for the interaction (no SimpliciTI) with a Ti CC2500 
  and a Raspberry Pi
  Since the SimpliciTI stack is far from simple this Program was build without the use of SimpliciTI.
  Maybe in the future there will be an implementation of the SimpliciTI here but for now I dont need it.
  
  Dont forget to configure your counter CC2500!
